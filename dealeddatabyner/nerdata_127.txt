She died peacefully in her sleep in the comfort of her own home, where she remained a keen observer of all things worldly, just as she had before and throughout her 62 years of marriage to her late husband <PERSON>Jim</PERSON>. Peggy was born in <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> on <DATE>April 13, 1927</DATE> to the late <PERSON>Samuel</PERSON> and <PERSON>Sadie Tenenbaum</PERSON>. The family moved to <LOCATION>Far Rockaway</LOCATION>, NY where she flourished as a student. She was the recipient of many youth academic awards for greater <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>, including ones for Latin, of which she perhaps was most proud. She became one of the younger students ever accepted to <ORGANIZATION>Smith College</ORGANIZATION> at age 16, and she earned her degree as a PHI BETA KAPPA member of the Class of <DATE>1947</DATE>. She married <PERSON>Jim</PERSON> on <DATE>May 27, 1951</DATE>, and they had two sons: <PERSON>Chris</PERSON>, born in <DATE>1955</DATE>, and <PERSON>Andy</PERSON>, born in <DATE>1957</DATE>. She worked for <ORGANIZATION>Time Magazine</ORGANIZATION>, a career that began before she became a mother, and it spanned 30 years. She was primarily a researcher, a unique one at that. For years, she was the back of the book rover, which meant every week she would add her assistance to whatever section of the magazine needed extra brainpower; whether it be the arts, medicine, law, travel, or even sports. She was honored to be a trusted member of the Presidential Election coverage team every four years. She and <PERSON>Jim</PERSON> raised their sons primarily in what was then known as Town of Rye, <ORGANIZATION>NY</ORGANIZATION>, where they lived from <DATE>1958</DATE> until <DATE>1974</DATE>, and then in <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>, where she lived for the past 40 years. During the boys' school years, and a bit beyond, she served as a trustee for the <ORGANIZATION>Hackley School</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Tarrytown</LOCATION>, NY. Peggy was a connoisseur of the Arts, frequently attending the symphony, opera, theater, and various museums. Yet, she also relished traveling. The family once had a home in <LOCATION>Weston</LOCATION>, VT, and later in <LOCATION>Sun Valley</LOCATION>, ID, where she enjoyed hiking, tennis, skiing, and sightseeing. She was fortunate enough to see many distant parts of the world. When travel proved too difficult in recent years, she could always count on crossword puzzles and bridge. She is survived by her two sons, <PERSON>Chris</PERSON> and <PERSON>Andy</PERSON>, and their wives, both named <PERSON>Katherine Berman</PERSON>. She will be greatly missed by her grandchildren <PERSON>Meredith</PERSON>, <PERSON>Doug</PERSON>, <PERSON>Sara</PERSON>, and <PERSON>Riley</PERSON>. A remembrance will be held <DATE>Monday, January 5th</DATE> at 11am at <ORGANIZATION>Congregation Emanuel of Westchester in Rye</ORGANIZATION>, NY. In lieu of flowers, expressions of sympathy may be made to <ORGANIZATION>Smith College</ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION>Bruce Museum</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Greenwich</LOCATION>.
