Fred passed ten years day death...","lead_paragraph":"<!-- FRED ROSENBERG -->ROSENBERG--Fred L.,<br\/><br\/> died peacefully a month shy of his 96th birthday while independently living in his new home amid new friends at Kendal on Hudson in Sleepy Hollow, NY on December 23, 2014. Fred passed ten years to the day after the death of his beloved wife of 56 years, artist Joan Mattison Rosenberg, who never left his thoughts. Navy Lieutenant on LST 281 in a D-Day Landing, and later captain of LST 357 in the Pacific, Fred went on to success as textile marketing executive for leading knit firms including Fab Industries, creating many iconic fabrics such as Supersuede. An avid sportsman, he played outfield for Syracuse University in the Class of 1939, semi- pro baseball in Boston, and into his 90s helped coach and took batting practice with The Kettle softball team in a Central Park league. Published playwright, poet, composer, and spirited performer for friends and family, Fred was a favorite piano pupil of Paul Creston, crooned with an orchestra in college, and was a lifelong student of music, literature and art. Warm, loving and spiritual, Fred is survived by his close sister Janet Black of Pocasset, MA, his dear daughter Vicki Rosenberg, his admiring son Eric and daughter-in-law Helen, and his devoted grandchildren Karen Rosenberg, Stuart M. Rosenberg, and Stuart's wife Halsey Varady. Memorial Service Sunday, January 25, 2015 at 11am at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. Contributions in Fred's memory may be made to The Art Students League of New York, attn: Joan M.
