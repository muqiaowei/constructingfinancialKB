Aaron had a wonderful life with no regrets; to quote Frank Sinatra, \"I did it my way\". An entertainment CPA, \"hand holder\" and most importantly a genuinely nice man for his career of sixty-five plus years. His wife, Elaine, served as his right hand through it all. They had an unshakeable bond that later generations hope to emulate. He leaves his wife, Elaine Abrams and three wonderful daughters --Annie Kasper (Tom), Sarah Gill (Tony) and Betsy Waters (Andrew) along with the great joys of his life --Rebecca, Caroline and Priscilla Kasper, Maxwell and Sammy Waters and Oliver Gill. He often quipped; \"We should have had the grandchildren first\". Also survived by his sailing buddies Ellen and Marty Abrams, brother Mike Shepherd, Alex Rooks and Jules Alexander and their families. In 2000, after enjoying Compo Beach in Westport, CT for thirty-seven years, Aaron and Elaine returned to Manhattan where he enjoyed his backyard, Central Park, as a visitor and volunteer. Donations in his honor may be made to the Aaron Schechter Baruch College Scholarship Fund, c\/o Baruch College Fund, One Bernard Baruch Way, Box A-1063, NY NY 10010. A memorial celebration will be held on Friday January 30, 2015 at 6pm at the Baruch Performing Arts Center Nagelberg Theater. Entrance on south side East 25th Street between Third and Lex.
