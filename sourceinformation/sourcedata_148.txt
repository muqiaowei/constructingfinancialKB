Born October 14, 1929, he was the first child of Isobel Ramsay Buckley and John Talbot Curtis. \"Chas\" grew up in Southport, CT and graduated from Deerfield in 1947 and Yale in 1951. He rose to Executive Officer and Navigator in the United States Navy, following a long line of military and naval service stretching back to Silas Talbot, Captain of the U.S.S. Constitution. Early in his career he joined Pepperidge Farm and became General Plant Manager in Norwalk, CT. Chas then joined White, Weld & Co. to pursue a long-held interest in stock picking and portfolio management. He ultimately retired at 72 as Senior Vice President of UBS, having retained many of his original clients. Making turns into his eighties, Chas had a lifelong interest in skiing, first courting his wife of fifty-seven years, Ellen Martin Whitaker, at Mad River Glen. They later introduced their three boys to the \"Alta Bounce.\" When not skiing, playing the drums, or listening to Louis Armstrong, he was a passionate and studious golfer at The Country Club of Fairfield, where he became President as his father had been. Chas also dedicated himself to Fairfield Country Day School as a long serving Trustee. Never happier than when out in the garden weeding, clipping, planting or supervising, he cherished his land at Mountain Meadow Farm in Weston, VT. Starting in 1964 with 20 acres and finishing with 192 acres, his careful and exacting stewardship of the trails, meadows, stonewalls, barn, milk house, sugar shack, and house may be his proudest legacy. He is survived by his wife, his sisters, Clare Rimmer of Kennebunkport, ME and Exeter, NH, Mollie Fair of Charleston, SC, and sons, John Talbot Curtis II of London England, Timothy Whitaker Curtis of Fairfield, CT, and Charles Buckley Curtis Jr. of Waitsfield, VT, along with seven skiing grandchildren. 1\/3","abstract":null,"print_page":"28","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  CURTIS, CHARLES BUCKLEY"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"CURTIS, CHARLES BUCKLEY"}],"pub_date":"2014-12-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"54aa0c9f79881040cba0f496","word_count":"325"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/12\/28\/business\/entering-the-secret-garden-of-private-equity.html","snippet":"It\u2019s a rare shift in a long-opaque industry: A firm is letting investors hire an outside monitor to review a fund\u2019s books and practices.","lead_paragraph":"It\u2019s a rare shift in a long-opaque industry: A firm is letting investors hire an outside monitor to review a fund\u2019s books and practices.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"subtype":"wide","url":"images\/2014\/12\/28\/business\/28-PRIVATE-1\/28-PRIVATE-1-thumbWide.jpg","height":126,"width":190,"legacy":{"wide":"images\/2014\/12\/28\/business\/28-PRIVATE-1\/28-PRIVATE-1-thumbWide.jpg","wideheight":"126","widewidth":"190"},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2014\/12\/28\/business\/28-PRIVATE-1\/28-PRIVATE-1-articleLarge.jpg","height":343,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2014\/12\/28\/business\/28-PRIVATE-1\/28-PRIVATE-1-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":"343"},"type":"image"},{"subtype":"thumbnail","url":"images\/2014\/12\/28\/business\/28-PRIVATE-JP\/28-PRIVATE-JP-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"width":75,"legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2014\/12\/28\/business\/28-PRIVATE-JP\/28-PRIVATE-JP-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Entering the Secret Garden of Private Equity ","print_headline":"Entering the Secret Garden of Private Equity"},"keywords":[{"value":"Private Equity","is_major":"N","rank":"1","name":"subject"},{"value":"Freeman Spogli & Co","is_major":"N","rank":"2","name":"organizations"},{"value":"Regulation and Deregulation of Industry","is_major":"N","rank":"3","name":"subject"},{"value":"Securities and Exchange Commission","is_major":"N","rank":"4","name":"organizations"},{"value":"Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010)","is_major":"N","rank":"5","name":"subject"},{"value":"Prices (Fares, Fees and Rates)","is_major":"N","rank":"6","name":"subject"},{"value":"Appelbaum, Eileen","is_major":"N","rank":"7","name":"persons"},{"value":"Prices (Fares, Fees and Rates)","is_major":"N","rank":"2","name":"subject"},{"value":"Pensions and Retirement Plans","is_major":"N","rank":"3","name":"subject"},{"value":"Securities and Exchange Commission","is_major":"N","rank":"4","name":"organizations"},{"value":"Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010)","is_major":"N","rank":"5","name":"subject"},{"value":"Private Equity","is_major":"N","rank":"6","name":"subject"},{"value":"Regulation and Deregulation of Industry","is_major":"N","rank":"7","name":"subject"}],"pub_date":"2014-12-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"SundayBusiness","section_name":"Business Day","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Gretchen","lastname":"MORGENSON"}],"original":"By GRETCHEN MORGENSON"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"549ed0ec7988105ced78871d","word_count":"1944"}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
